Days like this 
I want to drive away
Pack my bags and 
Watch your shadow fade

You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You tool my light, you drink me down
But that was then and this is now

Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No
Throw your sticks and stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No

I just wanna
Throw my phone away
Find out
Who is really there for me

You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now

Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No
Throw your sticks and stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No

Now look at me I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing oh Whoa 

So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah yeah except for me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No
Throw your sticks and stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No

This is the part of me
No
Away from me
This is the part of me me me me me me me me me me
No
Throw your sticks and stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No

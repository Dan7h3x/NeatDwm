Standing here, violent storm
Please take my place, I'm leaving it
behind
Yesterday, sudden goodbye
Take me back to another time

Standing straight, all is quiet
When will life start to fall apart?
Today won't go away
Pass me by, they all carry on

Standing still, constant stream
Turned up on the other side
Should I stay? Can't go back

Life goes on

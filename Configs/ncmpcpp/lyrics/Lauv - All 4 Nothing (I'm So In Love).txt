Intro
I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbyes
And all of those nights, they would just be all for nothing

Verse 1
Third of October
We were never sober the first few times that we hung out
But we fell in love somehow
First time that I met you
I didn't have a damn clue that I'd love everything about you
Now, I can't think of life without you

Pre-Chrous
Ay, did you know that you're my whole heart?
Ay, did you know that I'll never stop
No, giving you everything I got?
'Cause I'm so

Chorus
I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbyes
And all of those nights, they would just be all for nothing
Yeah, I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbyes
And all of those nights, they would just be all for nothing
Verse 2
Yeah, I'll never go back, I'll never go
Now that I know that, now that I know
I'll never leave you by your own
When you cry, baby, I'll be there, oh

Pre-Chorus
Ay, did you know that you're my whole heart?
Ay, did you know that I'll never stop
No, giving you everything I got?
'Cause I'm so

Chorus
I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't never wanna say goodbyes
And all of those nights, they would just be all for nothing
Yeah, I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbyes
And all of those nights, they would just be all for nothing

Bridge
Ay, did you know that you're my whole heart?
Ay, did you know that I'll never stop
No, giving you everything I got?
'Cause I'm so
Chorus
I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbyes
And all of those nights, they would just be all for nothing
Yeah, I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbyes
And all of those nights, they would just be all for nothing
Yeah-ey-ey
